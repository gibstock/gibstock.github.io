      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <p>As a bartender for the past decade, <span class='punch'>problem solving in real-time</span> was a constant necessity to succeed. There was never a day where everything went “smoothly” on its own, which meant there were endless opportunities for <span class='punch'>creative solutions</span>.</p> 

      <p>With bartending success came more responsibilities like <span class='punch'>managing teams</span> and <span class='punch'>interfacing with suppliers</span>. This is where my <span class='punch'>effective and clear communication</span> shone through. There are clear parallels in between the bartending and computing industries:</p> 

      <h2>Computing VS Bartending</h2>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="line">1</td>
            <td class="comparison">learning new languages and functions&colon; memorizing countless cocktail recipes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="line">2</td>
            <td class="comparison">using the languages and conventions established by management: following the bar procedures and protocols of wherever I worked</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="line">3</td>
            <td class="comparison">listening and adhering to clients’ needs: adapting to the need of every patron (client) that sat at my bar</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <!-- <ul>
        <li>learning new languages and functions &equals; memorizing countless cocktail recipes</li>
        <br>
        <li>using the languages and conventions established by management = following the bar procedures and protocols of wherever I worked </li> 
        <li>listening and adhering to clients’ needs = adapting to the need of every patron (client) that sat at my bar</li>
      </ul> -->
      <h2>Takeway</h2>
      <p>The wisdom leading to my success as a bartender was to <em>always enter a new situation with an <span class='punch'>open and elastic mind</span></em>. <br class="mobile-break"> <br class="mobile-break"> Quite too often, bartenders carry with them a ‘know-it-all’ attitude and that may give them success, but it is usually short lived. <br class="mobile-break"><br class="mobile-break">However, by allowing myself to <span class='punch'>listen and learn</span> the system of the current bar completely, I was always able to understand why they did things a certain way, then I could <span class='punch'>help make operations smoother</span>, which led to a much sturdier and long-term success and promotion.</p> 

      <p>I may be new to this profession, but my <span class="punch"> passion</span> and disposition <span class="punch"> for coding</span> spans decades.</p>
