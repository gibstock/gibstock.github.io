      <h2>Developer</h2>
      <small><a href="#projects">Jump to Projects</a></small>
      <p>I have spent the last <span class='punch'>3 years coding my brains out</span>. HTML has been a part of my life <span class='punch'>since 1998</span> when I started reading one of my Dad's big wordy books. In 2018 I got serious and worked my way through a Udemy Course. Endless YouTube tutorials have given me <span class='punch'>thousands of hours of coding</span>. I bricked my Surface Pro 4 becuase it couldn't handle the hours I was putting into it.</p>
      <p>I have spent the majority of my time making sure I fully understand <span class='punch'>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span> as the foundations for my coding. These fundamentals have made learning any language possible.</p>
      <p>Through my dedication, I have found a fundamental change in the way I process data. I have always been able to solve any problem, but now I feel <span class="punch"> 100% confident</span> that I can learn any language or set of tools to do so.</p>
      <p>My <span class='punch'>excitement for coding</span> drives me. More than money or career success. There is a deep satisfaction that comes from programming and understanding the concepts, even when I spend sleepless nights getting there.</p>
      <p>I may be new to this profession, but my <span class="punch"> passion</span> and disposition <span class="punch"> for coding</span> spans decades.</p>

      <h2>Previously...</h2>
      <p>As a bartender for the past decade, <span class='punch'>problem solving in real-time</span> was a constant necessity to succeed. There was never a day where everything went “smoothly” on its own, which meant there were endless opportunities for <span class='punch'>creative solutions</span>.</p> 

      <p>With bartending success came more responsibilities like <span class='punch'>managing teams</span> and <span class='punch'>interfacing with suppliers</span>. This is where my <span class='punch'>effective and clear communication</span> shone through. There are clear parallels between the bartending and computing industries:</p>

            <td class="comparison">using the languages and conventions established by management: following the bar procedures and protocols of wherever I worked</td>

          <tr>
            <td class="line">3</td>
            <td class="comparison">listening and adhering to clients’ needs: adapting to the need of every patron (client) that sat at my bar</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <!-- <ul>

        <br>

        <li>listening and adhering to clients’ needs = adapting to the need of every patron (client) that sat at my bar</li>
      </ul> -->
      <h2>Takeway</h2>
      <p>The wisdom leading to my success as a bartender was to <em>always enter a new situation with an <span class='punch'>open and elastic mind</span></em>. <br class="mobile-break"> <br class="mobile-break"> Quite too often, bartenders carry with them a ‘know-it-all’ attitude and that may give them success, but it is usually short lived. <br class="mobile-break"><br class="mobile-break">However, by allowing myself to <span class='punch'>listen and learn</span> the system of the current bar completely, I was always able to understand why they did things a certain way, then I could <span class='punch'>help make operations smoother</span>, which led to a sturdier program and longterm successs for the business.</p>

              <p>A lightweight actor searching web app. I built this after asking "What is he from??" for the umpteenth time and then spending too much time on the overbloated IMDB app. <br/> <br/>There were dozens of movie information API's that I could choose from, but I wanted to learn so I made my own. I crafted an API that crawls IMDB for the infromation that I wanted using axios and cheerio. It was a great learning experience and I have many more API's planned. <br/><br/>That was efficient enough and I could quickly hit the endpoint to see the movies in a json response, but I wanted to also provide this service for the rest of my family. So the What From? app was born. </p>
